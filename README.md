## About The Project

<p>A perfect first challenge if you're new to HTML and CSS. The card layout doesn't shift, so it's ideal if you haven't learned about building responsive layouts yet.
The main challenge is to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
<br><br>Your users should be able to:
<br>1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

<br>
<br> <p>I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.</p>

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

## What I learned

Very easy project for someone who recently stepped in the world of development! The only issue I had was the height of flex container as it looked different in Safari. So I changed approach a little bit - that's why I had many changes in this simple project.

## Useful resources

1. <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> - Paste your design image to check the size of containers, width, etc.
2. <a href="https://mybrowseraddon.com/page-ruler.html">Page Ruler</a> - Awesome Chrome/Firefox extension that helps you to match the pixels of the provided design.
